Here’s a clear, **zero-shot (aka “zero-step”) prompting** walk-through for the prompt:

> **Input prompt:** `Explain Ai in one sentence`

Zero-shot means you give **no examples**—only an instruction. The model relies purely on what it learned during pre-training + your instruction.

I’ll show the **end-to-end path** the model follows, with **tiny, illustrative numbers** (not the real model’s private weights). Where exact token IDs depend on the tokenizer/model, I’ll mark them as **example IDs**.

---

# 1) Normalize & wrap the prompt

**What happens:** The raw text gets normalized (Unicode handling, spaces), and the system/runtime may wrap it with system instructions and special tokens (e.g., BOS/assistant markers). We’ll keep it simple:

```
<bos> Explain Ai in one sentence <eos?>
```

- **Why:** Models learn on text streams with special markers (BOS = begin-of-sequence, EOS = end-of-sequence, role tags, etc.). This helps the model know where to start/stop.

**Sample (toy) special tokens:**
- `<bos>` → id **0** (example)
- `<eos>` → id **1** (example)

---

# 2) Tokenization (subword/BPE)

**What happens:** Text is split into subword pieces that map to integer **token IDs**. Real LLMs use byte-pair/Unigram tokenizers (e.g., OpenAI’s `cl100k_base`, SentencePiece, etc.). IDs vary by model.

**Illustrative split** (typical BPE uses leading-space markers, here shown with “▁” to mean “space”):
```
<bos>  Explain  ▁Ai  ▁in  ▁one  ▁sentence
```

**Example token IDs (illustrative):**
| Piece       | Example ID |
|-------------|------------|
| `<bos>`     | 0          |
| `Explain`   | 11987      |
| `▁Ai`       | 314        |
| `▁in`       | 69         |
| `▁one`      | 527        |
| `▁sentence` | 2931       |

**Why:** Subword tokenization lets the model cover rare/new words by composing pieces, while keeping the vocabulary manageable.

---

# 3) Build attention mask & positions

**What happens:** We compute:
- **Token sequence:** `[0, 11987, 314, 69, 527, 2931]`
- **Positions (0-based):** `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Attention mask:** `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (no padding in this short example)

**Why:** Transformers add **positional information** (so order matters) and use masks so tokens don’t attend to future tokens during generation.

---

# 4) Embed tokens + add positional encodings

**What happens:** Each token id is mapped to a dense vector (**token embedding**). A **positional embedding** (or rotary position encoding) is added.

**Illustrative shapes:**
- Vocabulary size: ~100k (real)
- Hidden size `d_model`: e.g., 4096 (real)
- Our toy example: `d_model = 8` (tiny, for numbers)

**Toy example (just to show the idea):**
```
embed(token=11987 “Explain”)  →  e_explain = [ 0.11, -0.23, 0.05, 0.40, -0.12, 0.07, 0.18, -0.03 ]
pos(1)                        →  p1        = [ 0.02,  0.01, 0.00, 0.03,  0.01,-0.02, 0.00,  0.02 ]
x1 = e_explain + p1           →  [ 0.13, -0.22, 0.05, 0.43, -0.11, 0.05, 0.18, -0.01 ]
```

**Why:** The model can’t infer order from a bag of tokens; positions give it sequence awareness.

---

# 5) Self-attention inside each Transformer block

**What happens:** For each layer:
1. Project each `x_t` into **Q**, **K**, **V** (query/key/value) per attention head.
2. Compute attention weights `softmax(QKᵀ / √d_k)` but **causally masked** (no peeking ahead).
3. Weighted sum of V’s → **context**.
4. Feed-Forward Network (MLP) + residual + layer norms.

**Toy numeric glimpse (2 tokens only to keep it tiny):**

Let’s say at the point of generating the **first output token**, the model has seen:
```
[<bos>, Explain, ▁Ai, ▁in, ▁one, ▁sentence]
```
For the **next token**, the last hidden state (position 5) produces Q; previous positions produce K,V. The attention computes “which previous words matter most” (likely `Ai`, `sentence`) to predict a one-sentence explanation.

**Why:** Attention lets the model focus on the most relevant parts of the prompt.

---

# 6) Output logits → probabilities

**What happens:** The final hidden state at the current position is projected to **vocab logits** (one number per token in the vocabulary). Apply **softmax** to get probabilities.

**Toy logits for a tiny candidate set** (just to illustrate the mechanics):

| Token (piece)   | Example ID | Logit |
|-----------------|------------|-------|
| `▁AI`           | 314        | 2.1   |
| `▁is`           | 45         | **6.3** |
| `▁the`          | 17         | 5.1   |
| `▁science`      | 901        | 5.5   |
| `▁of`           | 23         | 5.0   |
| `▁creating`     | 1456       | 5.2   |
| `▁machines`     | 1789       | 5.4   |
| `▁that`         | 66         | 4.9   |
| `▁can`          | 88         | 4.2   |
| `▁learn`        | 3001       | 5.0   |
| `▁and`          | 21         | 4.6   |
| `▁act`          | 2501       | 4.3   |
| `▁like`         | 120        | 4.1   |
| `▁humans`       | 3302       | 5.3   |
| `.`             | 13         | 5.8   |

Softmax turns these into a probability distribution; largest logit is picked by **greedy decoding** (or sampled if using temperature/top-p).

**Why:** Logits are unnormalized scores; softmax converts them to probabilities for decoding.

---

# 7) Decoding strategy (zero-shot)

**Zero-shot** is about **no examples** in the prompt. Decoding can still be:
- **Greedy** (take max prob each time) → most deterministic.
- **Top-k / top-p (nucleus)** sampling → more diversity.
- **Temperature** scaling → controls randomness.

For “Explain AI in one sentence,” you’ll usually want **greedy** or **low-temperature top-p** to keep it crisp.

---

# 8) Iterative generation (token by token)

**What happens:** The model appends one token at a time, then repeats steps 4–7 with the new longer context, until it meets a stop condition (EOS, max tokens, a period with stop rules, etc.).

**Toy run (greedy, illustrative IDs):**

- Context tokens so far:  
  `[0, 11987, 314, 69, 527, 2931]` → `<bos> Explain ▁Ai ▁in ▁one ▁sentence`

**Step t=1 (first output token):** highest prob = `▁AI` (id **314**) or `▁is` (id **45**).  
Model likely picks `▁AI` **or** starts with `AI▁is`. We’ll show a fluent greedy path:

1. `▁AI` (314)  
2. `▁is` (45)  
3. `▁the` (17)  
4. `▁simulation` (1711)  
5. `▁of` (23)  
6. `▁human` (1120)  
7. `▁intelligence` (2044)  
8. `▁by` (130)  
9. `▁machines` (1789)  
10. `.` (13)  
11. `<eos>` (1)

**Detokenized output:**  
`AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.`

*(Your actual model might produce a slightly different but equivalent one-liner, e.g., “AI is the science of creating machines that can learn and reason like humans.”)*

---

# 9) Post-processing & stop

**What happens:** The token stream is detokenized to text, extra spaces around punctuation are fixed, and generation stops at `<eos>` or a period if you provided a stop rule.

**Result (one sentence):**  
**“AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.”**

# 10) Minimal **toy** code: step-by-step scaffold

> This is **illustrative**. Real LLMs use huge matrices and learned weights. Here we fake a tiny vocab, a whitespace-plus-leading-space tokenizer, and a hand-crafted “model” that emits logits to produce a clean one-sentence answer.

```python
# --- Toy tokenizer (illustrative) ---
# Leading-space pieces use "▁" to mimic BPE behavior.

toy_vocab = {
    "<bos>": 0, "<eos>": 1, ".": 13,

}

id_to_piece = {v:k for k,v in toy_vocab.items()}

    # very simplified: split on spaces, add leading-space marker "▁" to non-first words
    words = text.strip().split()
    pieces = []
    for i, w in enumerate(words):
        if i == 0:
            pieces.append(w if w in toy_vocab else w)  # no change
        else:
            piece = "▁" + w
            pieces.append(piece if piece in toy_vocab else "▁" + w)
    return [toy_vocab[p] for p in pieces if p in toy_vocab]

        p = id_to_piece.get(i, "")
        if p in ["<bos>", "<eos>"]: 
            continue
        if p.startswith("▁"):
            out += " " + p[1:]
        elif p == ".":
            out = out.rstrip() + "."
        else:
            out += p
    return out.strip()

# 11) “Sample values” quick reference

- **Prompt pieces (example):**  
  `<bos> | Explain | ▁Ai | ▁in | ▁one | ▁sentence`
- **Example token IDs:**  
  `[0, 11987, 314, 69, 527, 2931]`
- **First few generated (greedy, example IDs):**  
  `▁is(45), ▁the(17), ▁simulation(1711), ▁of(23), ▁human(1120), ▁intelligence(2044), ▁by(130), ▁machines(1789), .(13), <eos>(1)`
- **Detokenized final sentence:**  
  `AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.`

> **Note on IDs:** Real IDs depend on the exact model tokenizer (e.g., OpenAI `cl100k_base`, Llama’s SentencePiece, etc.). The numbers above are **demonstrative**, not official.

---

# 12) Why zero-shot sometimes needs careful wording

- With no examples, the model leans on its **general world knowledge** and your **instruction phrasing**.
- Clear verbs (“Explain… in one sentence”) + constraints (length, style) steer decoding.
- For extra control, you can switch to **few-shot** (give 1–3 examples) or add **explicit style/length constraints**.

---

## TL;DR (one-screen summary)
1. **You type:** “Explain Ai in one sentence”.  
2. **Tokenizer → IDs:** text → subword pieces → integers.  
3. **Embeddings + positions:** tokens become vectors with order info.  
4. **Transformer blocks:** masked self-attention + MLP refine context.  
5. **Logits → softmax:** scores become next-token probabilities.  
6. **Decoding (greedy/top-p):** pick the next token.  
7. **Loop until stop:** produce a one-sentence answer.  
8. **Detokenize:** final string returned.

If you’d like, I can also generate a **Word-export version** of this (with tables and the toy code) or add a **few-shot** contrast section next.
